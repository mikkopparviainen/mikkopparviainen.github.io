<h4 id="bio">Introduction </h4>
My expertise is in audio signal processing including sound source localization, signal separation and enhancement, and binaural signal processing (personalization of head-related transfer functions). Furthermore, I am familiar with design of measurement setups. Recently, the research/processing methods that I have applied are based on artificial neural networks (e.g., utilizing Keras/Tensorflow and Pytorch frameworks), which can be utilized in many types of data including temporally dependent data (time series). Typical these tasks are more or less about data analysis meaning visualization and applying mathematical methods to get insights from where the data is originated therefore I am interested and experience of many kinds of data analysis techniques.
